# CoinBot

The CoinBot works with Puppetter library. Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium. With puppetter it's possible to use document.querySelecto to get the values from any URL.

The bot works with Readline-Sync library. Readline-Sync tries to let your script have a conversation with the user via a console, even when the input/output stream is redirected like your-script <foo.dat > bar.log.
